Person:
- I'm developping an application in Python. I'm adding a web server to the application, with FastAPI and uvicorn. The web server runs in a separate threads.
  I need to receive data from the web server and give these data to the main application. I also need the web server, the FastAPI application, to have access to some of the main application data, ideally directly calling some method in the main application.
  The main application is a class.
  I would like to avoir having to instanciante the main application class in the FastAPI application. I would like to have a clean architecture, with, at the minimum, a python file for the fastapi app, a python file for the main application and a python file for the resulting application which will be run by the user.
  Can you help me?

ChatGPT:
- Certainly, your requirement for a clean, modular architecture while integrating FastAPI with your main Python application is a sensible approach. It allows for better maintainability and separation of concerns. Here's a high-level plan to achieve this:
### High-Level Architecture:
1. **Main Application Class (MainApp):**
- This class contains the core functionality of your application.
- It exposes methods that can be called by the FastAPI server to access or modify data.
2. **FastAPI Application (WebApp):**
- This will handle all web server-related tasks.
- It needs to interact with the `MainApp` to get or set data.
3. **Interface Module (Interface):**
- Acts as a bridge between `MainApp` and `WebApp`.
- It defines interfaces or methods through which `WebApp` can interact with `MainApp`.
4. **Entry Point Script (RunApp):**
- This script starts the application.
- It initializes `MainApp` and `WebApp` and ensures they can communicate.
### Implementation Details:
1. **):**
- Define your application logic here.
- Include methods that can be accessed by the web server to manipulate application data.

```python
class MainApp:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization code
        pass

    def get_data(self):
        # Method to get data
        pass

    def set_data(self, data):
        # Method to set data
        pass
``` 
2. **):**
- This is your FastAPI application.
- It will use methods from the `Interface` to communicate with `MainApp`.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from interface import get_main_app_data, set_main_app_data

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/data")
async def read_data():
    return get_main_app_data()

@app.post("/data")
async def write_data(data: str):
    set_main_app_data(data)
    return {"status": "success"}
``` 
3. **):**
- This module provides functions that `WebApp` can use.
- These functions internally call the methods of `MainApp`.

```python
from main_app import MainApp

app_instance = MainApp()

def get_main_app_data():
    return app_instance.get_data()

def set_main_app_data(data):
    app_instance.set_data(data)
``` 
4. **):**
- This script starts your application.
- It initializes `MainApp` and `WebApp` and may handle threading for the web server.

```python
import uvicorn
from web_app import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start the web server in a new thread
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```
### Considerations:
- **Threading and Concurrency:**  Ensure thread safety when accessing and modifying shared data between `MainApp` and `WebApp`.
- **Dependency Injection:**  You may consider using dependency injection frameworks for more complex scenarios.
- **Design Patterns:**  Utilizing design patterns like Singleton for `MainApp` or Observer for notifications between `MainApp` and `WebApp` can be beneficial.

This structure maintains a clean separation between your main application logic and the web interface, promoting a modular and maintainable codebase.

Person:
- Can you add some data, for exemple a counter and a message string? And provide the code to read/write these data, with locking when necessary?

ChatGPT:
- Absolutely! Let's extend the example by adding a counter and a message string to the `MainApp` class. We'll also implement thread-safe read and write operations using Python's threading library to handle locking.
### Extended Main Application Class (`main_app.py`):

```python
import threading

class MainApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.counter = 0
        self.message = "Hello"
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def get_data(self):
        with self.lock:
            return {'counter': self.counter, 'message': self.message}

    def increment_counter(self):
        with self.lock:
            self.counter += 1

    def set_message(self, message):
        with self.lock:
            self.message = message
```



In this class, `counter` and `message` are data members. The `get_data` method returns both the counter and the message. The `increment_counter` method increments the counter, and `set_message` updates the message. Both these methods use a lock to ensure thread safety.
### Interface Module (`interface.py`):

```python
from main_app import MainApp

app_instance = MainApp()

def get_main_app_data():
    return app_instance.get_data()

def increment_main_app_counter():
    app_instance.increment_counter()

def set_main_app_message(message):
    app_instance.set_message(message)
```


### FastAPI Application (`web_app.py`):

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from interface import get_main_app_data, increment_main_app_counter, set_main_app_message

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/data")
async def read_data():
    return get_main_app_data()

@app.post("/increment-counter")
async def increment_counter():
    increment_main_app_counter()
    return {"status": "counter incremented"}

@app.post("/set-message")
async def write_message(message: str):
    set_main_app_message(message)
    return {"status": "message set"}
```



In the FastAPI application, we've added endpoints to read the data, increment the counter, and set a new message.
### Entry Point Script (`run_app.py`):

```python
import uvicorn
from web_app import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```



This script remains unchanged. It's responsible for starting the FastAPI server.
### Considerations:
- **Locking:**  The `threading.Lock` ensures that when one thread is modifying either the counter or the message, no other thread can read or write these data simultaneously, preventing race conditions.
- **Scalability:**  For more complex scenarios or higher scalability needs, consider using more advanced concurrency mechanisms or even external data stores with their concurrency controls.
- **Error Handling:**  You might want to add error handling and logging for a more robust application.

This implementation provides a simple yet effective way of safely sharing and modifying data between different parts of your application.
